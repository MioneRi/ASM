******NOTE : All programs work only in MS DOS (really old OS ^_^ ) !

Lab1: (*Don't remember sorry ^_^ )

Lab2.1: User inputs number1 and number2, result of dividing will print in console.

Lab2.2: The same as Lab2.1 but now program could also process keys : esc(or delete) and bcspace.

Lab3: The same as Lab2.2 but for signed numbers. (and now decimal part will desplay well)

Lab4: User inputs a string (example: "tat qwtatf")
	Program checks if str2(after space) contains str1(before space)
	and outputs "yes" or "no".

Lab5: Floyd's algorithm.
